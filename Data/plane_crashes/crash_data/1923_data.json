As the plane was incapable of maintaining level flight with only one engine operating, the pilot decided to make an emergency landing. He asked the mechanic to ask two passengers to move towards the rear of the aircraft. This instruction was apparently misunderstood by the passengers, as four of them moved towards the rear of the aircraft. This affected the center of gravity of the aircraft, which then entered into a spin and crashed."
