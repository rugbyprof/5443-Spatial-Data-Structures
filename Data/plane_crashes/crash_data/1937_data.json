Static conditions encountered in the last portion of the flight which rendered the reception of radio range signals unintelligible. The continuation of the flight into mountainous country at an altitude below of higher mountains without the aid of ground visibility or radio signals to definitely identify position. A change in the weather caused by the approach of an unpredicted cold front."
