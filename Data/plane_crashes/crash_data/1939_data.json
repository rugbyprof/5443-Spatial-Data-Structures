Either the hot metal of the engines or some other source ignited the fuel spilling out of the ruptured tank and the cabin was quickly engulfed in flames. The initial cause of the explosion was a cylinder blow out which was a problem with that particular engine and had caused problems in two other aircraft, a TWA and United DC-2, both of which landed safely."
