Kennedy volunteered for operation Aphrodite after completing two full combat tours and was killed when the explosive-laden PB4Y he was flying blew up in air. He was intending to aim the ship and bail out, leaving another aircraft to guide the PB4Y via remote control to a German submarine pen on the French coast; it apparently exploded when he armed the switches. The photographic chase plane had President Franklin Roosevelt's son, Elliot Roosevelt, on board."

Band leader and musician Glenn Miller, 40, killed along with flight officer John Morgan and Lt. Colonel Norman Baessell. It has been theorized the plane may have been hit by bombs being jettisoned over the English Channel by RAF bombers on their way home from an unsuccessful raid. Wreckage and bodies were never found. The most accepted explanation is the pilot was not instrument rated and flew into worsening weather conditions and possibly carburetor icing caused an engine failure causing the plane to crash into the English Channel."
