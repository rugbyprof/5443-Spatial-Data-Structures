About midway down the runway the plane swerved to the left and became airborne. The left wing dropped the wing tip dragged on the runway. After about 750 feet, the tail wheel made contact with the runway. The engines were cut and the plane skidded for 700 feet until it hit a hanger and burst into flames. The accident was caused by the crew's attempt to take off in an airplane which had formations of ice and frost on the surfaces of the wings. In addition, the plane was overloaded by 1,500 lbs."
