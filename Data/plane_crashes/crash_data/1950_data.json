The aircraft may have run out of adequate forward speed at an altitude of 400 feet after descending through a headwind level into a tailwind level when committed to land. With surface winds relatively calm and in 2,000 meters of sand haze, the winds at 400 ft. may have been in excess of 80 knots."

At 0801 the flight reported it reached cruising altitude and was headed toward Whitehall Range Station. This message was acknowledged. The next message from the flight was at 08:14 stating that it was over Whitehall Range Station and starting descent. Butte acknowledged this message and gave the flight the altimeter setting of 29.97, advised that the wind was south, calm, and the ceiling was lower to the east and north and better to the south and southwest. The flight replied that it had vertical visibility at 10,500 feet. This was the last radio contact with the flight. At approximately 0815 the aircraft had struck the eastern slope of a ridge about 30 feet below its crest, at an altitude of about 8,250 feet MSL. The site of impact was approximately 2 1/2 miles east of the control tower at the Butte Airport, and about 1-1/2 miles to the right of the center of the on course signal from Whitehall to Butte. Captain's failure to follow prescribed approach procedures."
