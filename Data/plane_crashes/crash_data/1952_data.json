While on approach, the plane crashed into the Puente Hills and burned. The pilot voluntarily descended below the minimum altitude for which he was cleared and attempted an approach at too low an altitude to clear the terrain. The pilot in command was flying with a restricted medical certificate. An emergency suspension was placed on the airline and it was discovered the airline had allegations of more than 40 violations listed against it including charges of overweight planes, excessive flying time for crews and failure to use approved seats and safety belts."

The co-pilot took over control and meanwhile the steward had come up to the cockpit to find out what was going on. As he knocked, the hijacker shot him twice through the cockpit door, killing him. The co-pilot changed course to China and continued at 6000 feet over the China Sea until two Chinese Nationalists T-6 Harvard planes showed up. Both planes chased the DC-3 and sprayed machine gun fire. The pilot managed to escape until he met with other Nationalist planes, who forced the flight to land at Quemoy. At Quemoy the hijacker was arrested."
