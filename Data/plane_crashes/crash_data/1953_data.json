        "Summary": "The aircraft crashed into Cedar Mountain following double engine failure. The progressive failure of both engines, due to the lack of compliance with proper maintenance standards. Spark plugs in both engines had been operated beyond their normal maintenance inspection period and exhibited evidence of a condition conducive to detonation and preignition. There was evidence that detonation and preignition took place in both engines and that they ultimately failed as a result of master rod bearing failures."
