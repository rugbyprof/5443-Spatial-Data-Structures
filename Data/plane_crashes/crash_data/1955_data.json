This overloaded the lighting circuit and blew a fuse. The plane crash-landed short of the runway and the pilot said it became so hard to control the aircraft that the absence of lights may not have mattered. One passenger died of his injuries almost 30 hours later."

        "Summary": "The aircraft crashed 11 minutes after taking off from Denver Stapleton Airport, 8 miles east of Longmont. Detonation of a dynamite bomb in the No. 4 cargo hold, placed by John (Jack) Gilbert Graham in his mother's luggage in order to collect $37,500 in insurance. A delayed flight caused the bomb to detonate over flat land rather than the mountains as planned. Graham never showed any remorse for his actions and refused to file any appeals. He was executed for the crime on 1/11/56."
