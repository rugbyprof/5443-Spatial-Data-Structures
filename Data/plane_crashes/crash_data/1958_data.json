This was not uncommon with this type of aircraft at higher altitudes and was usually caused the thrust being opened too fast. The second attempt to take off was aborted for the same reason. During the third attempt, as the plane passed V1 (committed to take off) the plane suddenly decelerated, never became airborne, crashed through the barrier fence, into a house and burst into flames. Eight members of the Manchester United football (soccer) team killed. A German inquiry concluded at an accumulation of ice on the wings was the cause of the accident, blaming the captain for not deicing the plane. Ten years later the British reopened the inquiry and concluded the accident was caused by slush on the last quarter of the runway. The reason other planes had taken off without incident was because they lifted in the air using only two thirds of the runway. The accident plane, because of the engine boosting, went further down the runway to take off. The aircraft was named \"Lord Burghley.\""

The approach was within tolerances and normal until after passing through GCA minimums, at which time the aircraft went below glide path and the pilot was instructed to take a waveoff. The waveoff was not executed until after the aircraft had actually made contact with the runway. After climbout, GCA was contacted and a second approach was requested to commence with no delay. The pilot advised GCA that the runway was in sight just before GCA gave him a waveoff on the first approach. The second approach was again normal until the final controller gave the instructions, \"Approaching GCA minimums.\" The aircraft immediately commenced dropping below glide path. An emergency pullup was given, but the aircraft collided with the water and came to rest 2,050 feet east of the approach end of the runway. It sank in 26 feet of water"
