Galeaoa approach was contacted and normal position reports were made. As the plane descended over Guanabara Bay in rain, the extended nosewheel struck the water. The crew tried to continue the approach, but the aircraft crashed near Flecheiras Beach, short of the runway. The actual cause of the accident was never determined however, the most probable cause was pilot error in descending below the minimum altitude on final approach. Aircrew fatigue was considered to be a contributing factor. Crew flight time exceeded the Brazilian limits, but did not exceed the German limitations."

J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson, who was suffering from the flu, talked Waylon Jennings into giving up his seat. Ritchie Valens won a coin-toss and went in place of Tommy Allsup. He commented \"I never won anything in my life\" after winning the coin-toss. The plane took off into deteriorating weather conditions. The pilot, Roger Peterson, was not certified to fly IFR. The wreckage of the plane was found the next morning in a snowy meadow, 5 miles NW of the airport. The plane hit the ground at a high rate of speed and singers Ritchie Valens, 17, Buddy Holly, 22, Jiles P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson, 28, as well as the pilot, were killed instantly. It appeared, the pilot became disoriented and flew the plane into the ground. Officially: The pilot's decision to undertake a flight in which the likelihood of encountering IFR conditions existed, when he was not certified to fly IFR. Also, deficiencies in the weather briefing and the pilot's unfamiliarity with the instrument which determines the attitude of the aircraft. In later years, a story appeared in the Iowa Globe Gazette in which a pilot, Al Potter, flying in the vicinity of the aircraft that night, claimed he was in contact with the aircraft shortly before it crashed. Potter stated the pilot radioed he had taken on ice and was losing power."

The aircraft struck the water while in shallow descent at 150 mph with its landing gear and flaps extended. Primarily the crash resulted from the failure of the crew to properly monitor essential instruments for determining attitude due to preoccupation with particular aspects of the aircraft and its environment. Limited experience of the crew with this particular type of aircraft. Erroneous setting of the captain's altimeter. Possibly misinterpretation of the altimeter and rate of descent indicator."
