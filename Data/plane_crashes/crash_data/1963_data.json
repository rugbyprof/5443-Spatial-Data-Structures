While trying to pull out of the dive, the aircraft broke apart from excessive g forces. The crew is believed to have concentrated on maintaining a given airspeed in an extreme turbulence condition instead of flying attitude. In doing so, excessive stress was applied to the wings which separated from the fuselage. The weather was considerably worse than forecast."

The aircraft then went back to the beginning of the runway and took off only to crash 10 minutes later, 18 miles WSW of Zurich. Braking done during the fog clearing procedure overheated the brakes which led to the wheel flange splitting and a burst tire which damaged a hydraulic line which caused a fire to start which ultimately led to the loss of control of the aircraft. Forty-three people, one fifth the population of the small town of Humilikon died in the accident."
