In addition the flight engineer instructor was being given a routine proficiency check. The flight departed the ramp at 00:40 with the captain trainee in the left seat and the check captain in the right seat. At 00:43 the crew advised the tower they were ready for takeoff and would like to circle and land on Runway 1. The tower cleared them as requested. The aircraft was observed to make what appeared to be a normal takeoff and departure. At 00:47 the crew reported on base leg for Runway 1, and the controller cleared the flight to land. A subsequent discussion revealed that they would execute a simulated two-engine out approach, execute a full stop landing and then takeoff on runway 19. The tower controller observed Flight 9877 in a shallow left turn on what appeared to be a normal final approach. The degree of bank increased to approximately 60 degrees or greater when the aircraft hit the power lines approximately 2,300 feet short and 1,100 feet west of the runway threshold. The DC-8 crashed into a residential area, destroying several homes and a motel complex. Improper supervision by the instructor and the improper use of flight and power controls by both instructor and the captain trainee during a simulated two-engine out landing approach."

        "Summary": "Shortly before reaching V1, the nose gear tire blew causing severe vibration. The crew aborted the takeoff and overran the runway into the sea. Loss of directional control developing from separation of the right nose wheel tread. Inability to stop within the normally adequate runway distance available due to use of differential braking, impaired performance and an increase in tail wind component and aircraft weight over those used in calculating the aircraft's acceleration /stoping performance."

        "Summary": "While on the takeoff roll a loud bang was heard as the aircraft passed a Delta plane and the takeoff was aborted. The aircraft overran the runway and crashed and burned. The inability of the TWA crew to abort successfully their takeoff at the speed attained prior to the attempted abort. The abort was understandably initiated because of the first officer's belief that his plane had collided with a Delta aircraft stopped just off the runway. A contributing factor was the action of the Delta crew in advising the tower that their plane was clear of the runway without carefully ascertaining the facts, and when in fact their aircraft was not a safe distance under the circumstances of another aircraft taking off on that runway."

The pilot decided to make a visual approach along the middle of 3 diverging roads, which was aligned with the runway. Because of the fog, the pilot began his approach along the third road which extended to the Royal Thai Air Force fuel storage instead of Runway 18. When the aircraft got close to the ground, the pilot realized that he was approaching the wrong road. He tried to initiate a go-around but the aircraft became unstable as he raised the nose slipped to the left and stalled the plane. The No.1 engine hit the ground first, 200 meters from the airport."
