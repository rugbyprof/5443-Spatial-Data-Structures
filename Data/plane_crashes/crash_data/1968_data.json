The Salt Lake control center had, in response to its vector request, informed the crew that there were no storm cells and no reports of icing along the airway being used. As a result, the pilot was unaware that turbulence encountered would be hazardous, worse than that predicted at the time of take-off. These turbulent conditions apparently caused the uncontrolled descent of the aircraft into the ground. The pilot was technically not qualified for the type of aircraft and was aware of the general weather conditions and should have discontinued the flight.."

While attempting to turn around by making a right hand turn, winds lifted the port wing, forcing the starboard wing down past 90 degrees. A stall resulted from this unusual attitude, pitching the nose down. During the recovery maneuver, the starboard wing was over-stressed, separating from the aircraft followed by the the tail and engines. The aircraft crashed into a field. Pilot's decision to penetrate a line of thunderstorms and severe weather. Visual perception of the pilot may have been reduced by a near lightning strike."

According to the NTSB, the captain said he was making a coupled approach, but because of problems with his pressure altimeter, he was relying on the more accurate radio altimeter for verification of altitude. The captain looked up expecting to be 200 feet above the water but instead was nearly in the water. He applied power but it was too late. The captain did not cross-check the raw data glide-slope signals and didn't realize the ILS on-course position was far above where he was. The improper application of the prescribed procedures to execute an automatic-coupled ILS approach. This deviation from the prescribed procedures was, in part, due t o a lack of familiarization and infrequent operation of the installed flight director and autopilot system. As a result, Japan Air Lines changed their training procedures to stress command responsibilities, crew coordination and transition time for new type of aircraft. The aircraft was recovered from the San Francisco Bay 55 hours after the accident, repaired at a United Air Lines facility and eventually flow back to Japan where it was put in service for many decades."
