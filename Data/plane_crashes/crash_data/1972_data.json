After leaving Mendoza and while flying at FL150, the copilot radioed he was over Curico and requested clearance to FL100. Because of head winds, the plane was actually still over the Andes. As the plane descended into clouds it ran into turbulence and the crew found themselves surrounded by mountains on all sides. The crew tried to climb out but the right wingtip struck the mountainside. The right wing detached and separated from the aircraft taking off part of the tail. The fuselage slid down a mountain slope and came to rest in the Andes mountains at an altitude of 12,000 feet. The survivors were not found until 12/22/72. Eight passengers died in an avalanche on October 30. Survivors resorted to cannibalism to stay alive. The book and movie \"Alive\" is based on this accident. The aircraft flew into a rotor zone or mountain wave which led to loss of control of the aircraft."

        "Summary": "The aircraft crashed while making a nonprecision instrument approach to Runway 31L. The accident occurred in a residential area approximately 1.5 miles southeast of the approach end of Runway 31L. Upon reaching mimimum descent altitude, the pilot raised the nose of the aircraft to stop the descent. The stall warning horn sounded and continued to sound until the plane crashed 17 seconds later. The aircraft was destroyed by impact and subsequent fire. The captain's failure to exercise positive flight management during the execution of a non-precision approach, which culminated in a critical deterioration of airspeed resulting in a stall from which level flight could no longer be maintained. U.S. Representative from Illinois George Collins killed. Wife of Watergates E. Howard Hunt, Dorothy Hunt, also killed."

The DC-9 came crashing back down on the runway and caught fire. Ten people out of 45 aboard the DC-9 were killed. None of the 88 aboard the Convair were killed. The ATC gave ambiguous instructions to the Delta crew, did not use all available information to determine the location of the CV-880 and the CV-880 crew did not request clarification of the controller's instructions."

        "Summary": "The crew was preoccupied with a landing gear problem and was trying to replace the landing gear light while on autopilot and in a holding pattern over the everglades. As the captain turned to tell the flight engineer to go below to check if the landing gear was down, he inadvertently pushed on the yoke releasing the altitude hold of the autopilot. With no ground reference and under nighttime conditions, the aircraft gradually descended until it crashed into Everglades, 18.7 miles west-northwest of Miami. The failure of the crew to monitor the flight instruments during the final 4 minutes of flight, and to detect a descent soon enough to prevent impact with the ground. After spare parts from the L-1011 were used on other planes, apparitions of the captain, Robert Loft and flight engineer, Don Repo began to be reported by Eastern employees. The book \"The Ghost of Flight 401\"and movies \"The Ghost of Flight 401\" and \"Crash\" are based on this accident. Three passengers and one crew member died in weeks following the accident making the total 103."
