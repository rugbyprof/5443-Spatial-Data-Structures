The pilot erroneously thought he had to contact Menhir control when passing the Nantes VOR. In order to delay their arrival at the VOR the Convair crew twice tried to request permission to carry out a 360-degree turn. When they did not get any answer from Marina control, they initiated the turn without clearance. While in the midst of an overcast, the Convair collided with the DC-9. The CV-990 lost an outboard portion of its left wing and managed to carry out an emergency landing at Cognac-Ch\u00e2teaubernard Air Base. The DC-9 lost control and crashed. The air traffic control system had been taken over that day by military personnel because of a strike of civilian controllers."
