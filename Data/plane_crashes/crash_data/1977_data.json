The KLM plane began its takeoff roll without permission with the Pan Am plane still on the runway. The controller and Pan Am pilot each radioed a warning to the KLM plane, but were not heard because the simultaneous transmissions interfered with each other.The KLM plane hit the Pan Am plane just as it was taking off. Both planes burst into flames. KLM 234 + 14 crew, Pan Am 326 + 9 crew killed. All aboard the KLM plane were killed. The KLM captain was their safety officer and for some months had been training other pilots using a simulator, where getting takeoff permission was not simulated. The Pan Am aircraft was named Clipper Victor. The KLM aircraft was named Rhine River. Despite all the circumstances the KLM plane was blamed for taking off without permission by the NTSB."

New engines were installed in the CH-53s to increase the power of the main rotor and on a whole to make the helicopter more powerful. However, it was soon evident that the tail rotor could not balance the increased power created by the main rotor. Under certain conditions the aircraft would become unstable and lose directional heading. Sikorsky warns of these conditions. To compensate for the mistake that had been made, Sikorsky designed and tested a bell crank system to stabilize the rear rotor. After seven years, this helicopter was still not retrofitted with the bell crank system. Gross weight of the container exceeded the lifting capacity of the helicopter. No restrains used by the passengers."

Hydroplaning, due to poor drainage on the runway. Excessive speed during landing. In the last attempt, the plane was 44 ft high in the begining of the runway flying at 150 kt. Then a sudden tail wind increases the speed to 155 kt. Cross winds from several directions made the plane unstable. Tail winds alternated with frontal winds making the speed unstable. The plane only hit the runway after 800m. The same cross winds make it impossible to align to the center of the runway. Then aquaplaning did the rest."

The controller's and flight crew's actions are attributed to probable habits of imprecise communication and of imprecise adherence to procedures developed through years of exposure to operations in a radar environment. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the aircraft's No.1 electrical system for unknown reasons."
