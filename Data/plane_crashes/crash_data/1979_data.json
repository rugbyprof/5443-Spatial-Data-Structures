A leak or break in the propeller pressure line probably caused the right engine to autofeather. The left engine was shut down when the flight crew failed to identify the engine on which the autofeather occurred and moved the left power lever to the stop position. Contributing to the accident was the unavailability of vital restart information to the crew."

The aircraft was flying at an altitude of approximately 34,500 feet, when the flight crew experienced a noise which they described as a thump. Smoke subsequently filled the cabin and the aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Washington-Dulles Airport. The bomb was planted by the Unabomber, a man who had been accused of attacks over an 18-year period. He was arrested in April 1996 and subsequently received a life sentence."

        "Summary": "During the descent the aircraft attained a high airspeed and high rate of descent and disintegrated in flight. A progressive failure in the aircraft's electrical system leading to the disabling or erratic performance of some critical flight instruments and flight instrument lighting while the flight was operating in night instrument meteorological condition. As a result of these conditions, the flight crew could not resolve the instrumentation anomalies to determine proper aircraft attitude reference, and became disoriented and lost control of the aircraft. The crew's efforts to regain control of the aircraft imposed aerodynamic loads which exceeded design limits of the aircraft and caused it to break up in flight."
