No wreckage or remains were ever recovered. The official cause remains unknown although it is believed the occupants lost consciousness due to oxygen deprivation. Louisiana State University football coach Robert \"Bo\" Rein, 34, was killed."

When this was discovered, an attempt was made by either French or US aircraft to intercept the MiGs. It was believed that a shot fired at the MiGs accidentally struck Itavia Flight 870. The aircraft exploded and crashed off the island of Ustica. A report released in 1994 stated new evidence pointed to an explosive device aboard the aircraft causing the crash."
