The aircraft reached a peak altitude of 300 ft. The flight crew's failure to use the engine anti-icing system during takeoff. Failure to de-ice the plane a second time before takeoff and taking off with snow/ice on the airfoil surfaces of the aircraft. Ice which accumulated on the engine pressure probes resulted in erroneously high Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) readings. When the throttles were set to takeoff EPR, the engines were actually developing significantly less than takeoff thrust. The crew's inexperience in icing condtions was a contributing factor."

The pilot's decision to retain autothrottle speed control throughout the flare and the consequent extended touchdown point on the runway contributed to the severity of the accident."

The pilot was attempting to buzz Osbourne's tour bus when after several attempts, the left wing struck the side of the bus puncturing it in two places approximately half way down the right side. The plane was thrown over the bus, hit a pine tree, severing it approximately 10 feet up from the bottom, before it crashed into the garage of a house. The plane was an estimated 10-11 feet off the ground traveling at approximately 120 - 150 knots during final impact. Several other members of the group were inside the bus but were not hurt. The pilot, Andrew Aycock's medical certificate (3rd class) had expired, making his pilots license invalid. All three aboard, Rhoads, Rachel Youngblood, the groups hairdresser and the pilot were killed. Poor judgement by the pilot in buzzing the bus and misjudging clearance of obstacles."
