A computer known as the \"Fuel Quantity Information System Processor\" was not working properly so the ground crew made manual calculations for the amount of needed fuel. However, they used pounds/liter for the specific gravity factor instead of kilograms/liter. This was first model of aircraft of Air Canada to use kilograms. The aircraft ran out of fuel at 41,000 feet. With only standby instruments (magnetic compass, artificial horizon, airspeed indicator and altimeter) and no slats or flaps, the plane landed safely on a 7,200 ft. runway at Gimli, a former Air Force base converted into a racing drag strip. The plane became known as the \"Gimli Glider.\" The TV movie Falling from the Sky: Flight 174 was made about this incident in 1995."

U.S. Representative from Georgia Lawrence McDonald killed. Because of an improper navigational setting the plane drifted off course. There was a U.S. spy plane in the vacinity of the 007 flight. The 007 plane was mistaken for the spy plane. The fighter pilot was ordered by Soviet command to shoot down the plane. Two air-to-air missiles were launched by the fighter and struck the Boeing 747. Cabin pressure was lost and the aircraft suffered control problems, causing the plane to go into a dive and break up, crashing into the ocean."

        "Summary": "The airliner crashed on approach in adverse weather. Instead of a go-around the pilot put the plane in a tight turn to the right with a high slip angle, leading to a loss of airspeed. After descending through decision height the pilot attempted a go-around but the plane rolled to the left and lost altitude. After the bank angle reached 90 degrees the aircraft crashed short of the runway."
