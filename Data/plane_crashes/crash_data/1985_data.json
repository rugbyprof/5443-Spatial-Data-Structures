The autopilot disengaged after it could not handle the excessive roll caused by the shut down engine. The captain failed to make the proper flight corrections to recover the aircraft. After a terrifying series of inadvertent aerobatics, the plane leveled off at 9,500 feet and managed to land safely at San Francisco. Forces during the inverted spin were estimated to be from +6G to -4G. The landing gear was forced out through the closed doors, breaking the doors, which flew back and took out part of the rudder and elevator."

Slow braking, using reverse thrust and turning the aircraft so it stopped with fire upwind of the fuselage, all helped to feed the flames.

The minority opinion was that the crash was possibly caused by detonation of an explosive device of unknown origin in a cargo compartment which led to an in-flight fire and loss of control of the aircraft."

The fire most likely started in a defective cabin heater but was not determined for sure. Singer Rick Nelson, 45, fianc\u00e9e Helen Blair, 27, soundman Clark Russell and the members of his back-up group The Stone Canyon Band, Andy Chapin, 20, Rick Intveld, 22, Bobby Neal, 38, and Patrick Woodward, 35 were killed. Both pilots survived after climbing out the cockpit windows. Nelson had purchased the DC-3 in May 1985 from Jerry Lee Lewis and the craft had been forced to make two emergency landings in the previous six months. Nelson and his band were en route to perform at the half-time festivities at the Cotton Bowl."
