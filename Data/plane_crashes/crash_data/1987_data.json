Permission was given by March Air Force Base ATC to perform a \"maximum climb\" takeoff. The aircraft was seen disappearing into a scattered cloud ceiling at 4,700 feet. Radar contact was lost 9 minutes into the flight. The crash site was found on the 3rd day of searching in the San Bernardino Mountains. An investigation revealed the aircraft flew, inverted, into a solid wall of granite between two mountain peaks at an altitude of 3,750 feet and at an estimated speed of 560 mph. The aircraft was literally pulverized into the granite. The \"maximum climb\" takeoff, g forces associated with this type of flight and the dense cloud cover negatively affected the pilots ability to know his position and aircraft attitude."

        "Summary": "A fired USAir employee, David Burke, after leaving a goodbye message to friends, shot both pilots with a .44 Magnum pistol. While the aircraft was cruising at 22,000 feet over the central California coast, the cockpit crew heard two shots in the passenger cabin and radioed a frantic message to air traffic controllers: \"There\u0092s gunfire aboard.\" Moments later, the plane entered a high-speed nosedive and smashed onto the ground at 700 mph at 5,000 g's . Investigators sifting through the wreckage were able to retrieve the plane\u0092s cockpit voice recorder, which subsequently revealed the sounds of a commotion in the cockpit, three more shots, the groan of the pilot or co-pilot, and then a final shot."
