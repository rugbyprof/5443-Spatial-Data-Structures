        "Summary": "The aircraft hit a mountain while on approach to Strasbourg. The crew was making a non-precision approach to runway 05. Design deficiencies with the rate-of-descent mode selector switch. The captain inadvertently selected 3,300 fpm descent on approach (displayed as 33) instead of 3.3 degree flight path angle (displayed as 3.3 in the same place on the panel) and this went unnoticed. The plane was slightly off course due to ATC error. No GPWS was installed. Both pilots had little time in an Airbus 320. There was inadequate training for non-precision approached. The electronic locator beacon was destroyed in crash, putting survivors at risk for over 4 hours before the wreckage was located."

Failure of the airline industry and FAA to provide flight crews with procedures compatible with departure delays in conditions conducive to airframe icing and the decision by the flight crew to take off without positive assurance that the airplane's wings were free of ice accumulation after 35 minutes of exposure to precipitation following de-icing.

After experiencing difficulty in deploying the flaps, the captain stated they were too high to come in for a direct landing. He asked to go around and make the approach again. The ATC did not have radar service. After some confusing exchanges between the tower and the aircraft, the captain instead of making a 180 degree turn towards the south, continued the turn to 360 degrees and headed north again. The aircraft eventually flew into a near vertical mountain wall at 240 knots. In the final seconds, the captain interpreted the Ground Proximity Warning System warning as false. The accident was caused by a combination of occurrences, errors and actions by the captain and ATC. Specifically, the initial problem with the flaps, the lack of radar service, the captain trying to performing too many duties instead of relying on his co pilot,and the use of non-standard phraseology."

        "Summary": "Shortly after taking off from Schiphol Airport, while climbing through 6,500 feet, the No. 3 engine separated with its pylon from the aircraft and damaged the leading edge of the right wing. The No. 3 engine separated in such a way that the No. 4 engine and pylon also separated from the wing. During an attempted return to the airport, the aircraft crashed into a 11 story building in the Bijlmermeer residential district. The design and certification of the B-747 pylon was found to be inadequate to provide the required level of safety. The system to ensure structural integrity by inspection failed. The separation of the No. 3 engine was initiated by fatigue (corrosion) in the inboard midspar fuse pin. This led to loss of the No. 4 engine and pylon and damage to several systems which ultimately led to loss of control of the aircraft."

The combination of both factors caused stresses which exceeded the structural limitations of the aircraft. In addition, there were four moments when the pilots should have decided to abort the landing and do a go-around. This because the runway was flooded with water, the plane had left the flight path and was unstable during landing. In addition, the pilots did not properly correct for the windshear, flew too slowly and made errors with the automatic pilot."
