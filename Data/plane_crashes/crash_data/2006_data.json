The captain, being in a psychoemotional stress condition, made nose down control inputs due to the loss of pitch and roll awareness.This started the abnormal situation. The captain's insufficient pitch control inputs led to a failure to recover the aircraft and caused it to crash. Along with the inadequate control inputs from the captain, the contributing factors of the crash were also the lack of monitoring the aircraft's pitch attitude, altitude and vertical speed by the first officer and no proper reaction by the crew to GPWS warnings."

The plane crashed in a field, 30 miles North of Donetsk and broke-up. Weather forecasters reported thunderstorms and lightning in the area at the time of the crash. The crew pushed the aircraft beyond its limits as they attempted to fly around a thunder storm. The crew steered the aircraft under manual control into an angle of attack that was beyond critical which resulted in a stall and the subsequent transition into a flat spin and a collision with the ground."

        "Summary": "The jet commuter was the third of three airplanes to take off that morning. The previous two planes took off from Runway 22 without any problems. The flightcrew was cleard to taxi to Runway 22 and subsequently cleared for takeoff. However, flight 5191 used Runway 26, which is about half the length of Runway 22. The plane accelerated to 137 knots befoe it ran off the end of the runway, ran through an airport perimeter fence and impacted trees on an adjacent horse farm and burst into flames. The takeoff sequence took about 36 seconds. The aircraft was still on the ground as the plane ran off the runway.The plane came to rest about 1,800 feet past the runway. It was dark with light rain at the time of the accident. The copilot was at the controls but it was the captain who taxied the plane into position for take off. The copilot was the lone survivor. The flight crew's failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to this accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversation during taxi, which resulted in loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances."

While en route the jetliner collided with an Embraer EMB-135BJ Legaacy 600 business jet. The Embraer was able to land safely at Serra de Cachimbo with a damaged wing and tail. Five passengers and two crew members on the Embraer were not injured. All 154 on board the 737 were killed. The flight recorder transcript from the executive jet showed that the pilots were told by Brazilian air traffic control to fly at the same altitude as the Boeing 737 before the planes collided. A Brazilian Air Force investigation concluded that a switched-off transponder on the EMB-135 contributed the plane crash. The report also said flight controllers failed to alert the pilots they were on a collision course and failed to notice the transponder was turned off."

All six spoilers failed while landing. Even with the failed spoilers, a damp runway and a slight tailwind, there should have been sufficient room to stop. However, when the pilots realized the spoilers had failed, one of them selected emergency braking not realizing that this deactivated the antilock braking system."
