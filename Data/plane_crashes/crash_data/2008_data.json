An investigation showned that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted; most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. The ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel, and should have been melted by the fuel-oil heat exchanger (FOHE). However, the FOHE did not heat its own inlet face, and investigation showed that, although the flight was within the certified operational envelope at all times, a long period of low fuel flow in an unusually cold environment, followed by a throttle increase, could cause an ice jam at that point. Corrections in design were made so this would not occur again."

One person survived the accident but died later. The pilots were both working on insufficient sleep and displayed poor coordination with one another. The pilots failed to account for a wet runway and 8-knot tailwind when they touched down on the 5,500-foot runway, and they should have applied a braking system a full seven seconds earlier than they did.Realizing they were running out of runway, the pilots hit the throttles to try to take off again. Had the pilots hit the lift dump right after touchdown, or landed into the wind, the plane probably could have stopped safely on the runway. The accident was due to the captain's decision to attempt a go-around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident were the pilots' poor crew coordination and lack of cockpit discipline.; fatigue, which likely impaired both pilots' performance and failure of the FAA to require crew resource management training and standard operating procedures for Part 135 operators."

The forward left cabin door was not closed completely, and that the person who closed it was an engineer who was not listed among those (in the Cabin Attendant Manual) who were supposed to close the door. A report concludes that the aircraft originally lost cabin pressure due to this. 1) Failure of the crew to maintain proper crew resource management and cooperation in flight 2) Failure to maintain visual contact with the runway or visual approach aids during a visual approach 3) Loss of control with regards to height while doing the orbit necessary due to miscalculation of the landing performance and estimated landing trajectory 4) Failure to respond correctly to the TAWS alert (Terrain Awareness and Alerting System)."

        "Summary": "The Airbus A320 was leased by XL Airways of Germany since May 2006. The plane was scheduled to be returned to its owner, Air New Zealand. The plane was ferried to Perpignan, France where it underwent maintenance at EAS Industries. During a second test flight, on approach to Perpignan, at 3,500 feet, radio contact was lost. A controller reported seeing the plane descending quickly in a left bank. The aircraft soon after crashed into the sea and broke up. While attempting to test slowing the airplane to an unsafe speed, the plane's computer failed to automatically recover to safe flight, The plane stalled and crashed. The reason the computer failed was that both angle-of-attack sensors were frozen.The reason water froze in the sensors was the plane had been washed using a firehose without protecting the sensors."

During the takeoff roll the plane was blown sideways by a 45-knot gust, well outside the captain's experience and training. When the rudder did not immediately correct the yaw, he assumed it had failed and stopped trying it. The plane ran onto rough terrain near the runway and was destroyed by impact and fire."
