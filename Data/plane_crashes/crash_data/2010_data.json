The crew requested permission to carry out a trial approach to a decision height of 100 m and told the controller to expect a go-around. A few seconds before impact, the autopilot and autothrottle were disconnected in order to execute a go-around. The airplane impacted upsloping terrain at a distance of about 1,100 meters from the runway and 40 m to the left of extended centerline. The immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the crew to make a timely decision to proceed to an alternate airport although they were not once timely informed of the actual weather conditions at Smolensk, which were significantly lower than the established airport minima. Descent without visual contact with ground references to an altitude much lower than minimum descent altitude for a go-around, in order to establish visual flight. No reaction to the numerous TAWS warnings which led to controlled flight into terrain, aircraft destruction and death of the crew and passengers. Polish president Lech Kaczynski and his wife were among the dead."

Failure of the two pilots to coordinate their actions during the initial approach, with the final approach attempted below the minimum descent altitude and the runway not visible. Realizing that the approach had been misjudged, the co-pilot, who was in command, attempted to pull the plane up in order to perform a new landing, which disabled the auto pilot, but the captain had retaken control of the aircraft without informing his co-pilot, leading to the crash. Lack of coordination between the two pilots and the inappropriate application of flight control inputs during the attemped go-around. The length of the trip and crew fatigue was a factor."

        "Summary": "The airliner crashed onto the runway and broke in two during a major storm. One hundred twenty four people were injured. One passenger died of a heart attack and a 11- year-old girl died later of head injuries. Execution of the flight below the angle of approach, due to a misjudgment of the crew, believing to be much higher, leading the aircraft to fly a typical trajectory of a 'black hole' illusion, which was experienced during the night-time approach to a runway with low contrast surrounded in bright focused lights, aggravated by bad weather of heavy rain."
