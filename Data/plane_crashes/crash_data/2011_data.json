The plane carried the entire Lokomotiv Yaroslavl ice hockey team. Pilot error. Both pilots had experience on the Yak-40 but were assigned to switch between types , contrary to proper practice. They apparently had never learned the correct position for their feet on takeoff. In the Yak-42, and like virtually all other existing Russian and Western planes, a pilot steers the aircraft by pressing the lower part of pedals and activates the brakes by pressing their upper part.But instead of putting his heels on the cockpit floor as required, One pilot left his feet resting on the pedals, as correct for the Yak-40. This applied the brakes, causing a downward pitch force that prevented the plane from rotating to take off. They made the fatal mistake of failing to abort the takeoff, but kept applying more upward pitch with the result that when the plane finally left the ground and the downward pitch force stopped, it went into a stall within seconds."

Overspeeding of both propellers. The plane had to be manually flown because the aircraft's yaw damper was unserviceable. Neither pilot noticed the aircraft's speed increasing to its maximum operating speed. The pilot-in-command pulled the power levels of the plane 'quite quickly'. Moments later both propellers over-sped simultaneously. The over-speeding propellers back-drove the turbines in the engines (instead of the engine turbines driving the propellers) and this caused severe damage to the left engine.After the emergency began, the first officer quickly identified the double propeller over-speed. At about the same time, smoke appeared in the cockpit and various aircraft system malfunction alerts activated. The crew did not respond to any of these alerts by implementing the emergency procedures detailed in company manuals and the quick reference handbook."
