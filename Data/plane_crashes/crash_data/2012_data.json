The contributory factors include the crew\u0092s decision to continue the flight through significant changing winds associated with the prevailing weather conditions and the lack of experience of the crew to the airplane\u0092s automated flight deck"

The pilot in command switched the TAWS off, assuming there was a database problem. In addition, the flight crew were distracted by a customer in the cockpit and failed to complete a planned turn. Due to inadequate maps, briefing, and low clouds, the crew did not know there were mountains in the area."

The airplane then crashed into the sea and broke apart off the shores of Masbate Island some 980 ft away from the island's airport. An investigation found that improper maintenance led to the right engine suffering an internal failure, which likely would have caused misfiring and intermittent operation of the fuel pump. The failure was gradual and the aircraft developed engine problems 23 minutes after take off. However, instead of turning back to Cebu, the pilot decided to continue the flight, until the engine failed completely, 37 minutes later and the aircraft crashed during the subsequent attempt to land at Masbate. The investigation determined that the pilot didn't use the correct procedure for trying to land a Piper Seneca with one engine inoperative, in that he lowered the undercarriage and flaps too soon; and that during his last flight proficiency test he had not been tested with respect to flying with one engine inoperative."
