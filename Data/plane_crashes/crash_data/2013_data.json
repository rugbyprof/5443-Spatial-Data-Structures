Wreckage was discovered on Saturday with the pilot and copilot fatally injured. The aircraft was badly fragmented in three sections. The flight crew's failure to maintain terrain clearance, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain in instrument meteorological conditions. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's failure to correctly read back and interpret clearance altitudes issued by the air traffic controller, their failure to adhere to minimum altitudes depicted on the published instrument approach chart, and their failure to adhere to company checklists. Also contributing to the accident were the air traffic controller's issuance of an ambiguous clearance to the flight crew, which resulted in the airplane's premature descent, his failure to address the pilot's incorrect read back of the assigned clearance altitudes, and his failure to monitor the flight and address the altitude violations and issue terrain-based safety alerts."

The tail section, landing gear, and both engines separated from the fuselage and a fire erupted. Debris was scattered from the ocean front to the runway to where the aircraft came to rest. The plane's voice and flight data recorders show that the aircraft was coming in too slow and too low and that the pilots appear to have increased speed seven seconds before impact. A stall warning sounded four seconds before the crash, and the crew then made an internal decision \"to initiate a go-around 1.5 seconds to impact.Two passengers were killed and 182 injured. One passenger was run over by one of the emergency vehicles. The crew's failure to monitor and maintain the plane's airspeed, and its failure to abort the landing when in trouble. The pilot and co-pilot reasonably believed the automatic throttle would keep the plane flying fast enough to land safely, when in fact the auto throttle was effectively shut off after the pilot idled it to correct an unexplained climb earlier in the landing. The flight crew over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand."
