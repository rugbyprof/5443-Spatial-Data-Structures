In unknown circumstances, the airplane went out of control and crashed into the ocean about 1,440 km east of the coast of New Jersey. SAR operations were initiated but eventually suspended a few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the 10 crew members was found. Due to lack of evidences, the exact cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty."

In the accident sequence, the nose gear collapsed, the forward service door (1R) escape slide inflated inside the airplane and the forward dual flight attendant jumpseat, which was occupied by two flight attendants, partially collapsed. Two passengers sustained serious injuries and 41 passengers and the captain sustained minor injuries. The flightcrew's excessive airspeed and flight path angle during the approach and landing and its failure to abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. Contributing to the accident was the controller's positioning of the airplane in such a manner as to leave no safe options for the flightcrew other than a go-around maneuver."

Before contact was lost, the pilot requested a route change due to weather conditions. Preliminary indications are the plane ran into poor weather and stalled from FL320. The rudder travel limiter faulted 3 times during the flight. On the fourth fault the captain decided to try resetting the system by pulling circuit breakers as he had seen a maintenance technician do on the ground. This caused the autopilot to disengage causing the plane to bank 54 degrees. The the first officer, who was flying, became disoriented and was slow to correct the bank. He then put the plane into a steep climb that caused the aircraft to stall and eventually crash. Records show that the plane flew with that mechanical problem for 12 months preceding the accident."

The event was controllable if the captain had not allowed the airspeed and resulting control forces to increase while he tried to troubleshoot the problem. By allowing their airplane's speed to increase while engaging in poorly coordinated troubleshooting efforts, the pilots allowed and abnormal situation to escalate to an emergency."

About 20 members from the Dutch soccer team \"Colorful 11\" from Surinam were killed."

        "Summary": "The crew reported that they had a loss of fuel and were going to have to divert to Lajes AFB. Shortly thereafter, they said that they only had five minutes of fuel and probably would not reach Lajes. The Airbus 330, without engine power, glided for almost 20 minutes, descending from for more than 30,000 ft. before landing safely at Lajes Airport. Several tires blew out causing a fire which was quickly extinguished by emergency crews. Eleven passengers were slightly injured. The leak was caused by a damaged fuel feed pipe that was caused by interference from the aft hydraulic pump. Mechanics did not completely follow a Rolls-Royce service bulletin. In addition, software mistakenly identified the fuel leak as a fuel imbalance, prompting the crew to respond erroneously to the situation. The official report stated the cause was the pilots responded incorrectly to the fuel leak. The pilots acted from memory rather than utilizing a checklist, so they never saw a \"Caution\" note in the Fuel Imbalance checklist that might have caused them to consider that the real problem was not an imbalance but a fuel leak."
